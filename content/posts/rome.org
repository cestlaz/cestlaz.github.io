Time for a trip report.

Been in Bologna for a few days now but before that, we started in
Rome. Now, I was correctly informed that Italy in August isn't the
smartest move - it's *hot* - 97 degrees out as I'm writing this
post. Not pleasant outside. Still, Rome was pretty awesome even if I
did fade in the afternoons.

Why Italy? It was Natan's choice. Having graduated right before Covid,
Natan hasn't had a chance for a real vacation for years. We thought
we'd do a family thing. He's a big opera fan and there's a Rossini
festival in Pesaro Italy starting on August 10th so that was the
target. A few days in Rome, a few in Bologna, down to Pesaro for three
days and the festival, then back to Rome then home.

As usual we did a lot of walking. All around Rome.

Here are some of the places and things we visited.

- Trajan and Titus's  Baths
- Papal basilica if Saint Mary Major
- Moses Fountain
- The Colloseum / Forum / Paletine Hill
- The Great Synagogue
- Castel Saint Angelo
- Saint Andre Della Valle
- The Palazzo Farnese
- Fountain of the Four Rivers
- Saint Agnese in Agone
- Largo de torre argentina (where they went all stabby on Julius
  Caesar)
- The Pantheon
- Capuchin Crypt and Museum
- Galleria Borghese
- Spanish Steps
- The Trevi Fountain 

Here are some highlights:

Maybe the best bang for the buck was [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castel_Sant'Angelo][Castel Saint Angelo]]. It's a
little off the main tourist path so it wasn't that crowded but it was
pretty amazing. Originally built by Hadrian for his mausoleum it was
later used as Papal residences as well as for a prison and a
fortress. Inside it's got it's own architecture and artifacts and
there are also museum sections. The result is you get ancient roman
history and art, Catholic history and art, military stuff, and
more. All with some great views.

We easily spent a morning there.

We only ended up going to Castel Saint Angelo due to Natan. As I
mentioned, he's really into opera. Last year we saw [[https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tosca_(opera)][Tosca]], an opera by
Puccini. Tosca is an opera in three acts and each act is at a real
location in Rome. The third act takes place at Castel Saint Angelo
where Tosca flings herself off the parapet. Act 2 takes place at the
Palazzo Farnese, now the French Embassy and the first at Saint Andre
Della Valle, a nearby church.

The other unexpected highlight was the Villa Bourghese.

Great collection of artwork in an amazing space.

A "Last Supper" that we prefer due to the cute doggie:

Also highly recommended.

Of course, in our wanderings we saw so much more:

I won't bore you with more pictures but the Jewish Museum and
Synagogue were also really interesting. Learned about the Jewish
population in early Rome, through the expulsion, discrimination under
Papal rule, periods of acceptance and more. Obviously the other big
sites were also pretty awesome.

On our last day, we also visited the Capuchin museum and
crypt. Fascinating. In addition to the museum with a history of the
order the crypts are decorated with the bones of the friars (more info
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capuchin_Crypt][here]]). Really interesting.

The Churches were also all amazingly ornate. I appreciated the beauty
but also questioned the excess having seen these extravagent houses of
worship which were only matched by the palaces of the ultra rich and
powerful like the The Palazzo Farnese.

Finally, lots of good food and much gelato - a necessity in 90+
degree heat.

So that's the Rome report. Next up Bologna and tomorrow we leave for
Pesaro.
