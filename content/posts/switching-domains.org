So, while I'm working on getting off of Google, I thought it was also
time to unlink my blog from GitHub.

It's still, at least for the time being, hosted on GitHub but I've
switched it over to my domain.

The blog's official address is now [[https://cestlaz.zamansky.net][cestlaz.zamansky.net]]. The old
address of [[https://cestlaz.github.io][cestlaz.github.io]] should still work since it's still hosted
on GitHub. I'll probably move the actual hosting somewhere else at
some point int he future.

*IMPORTANT for RSS PEOPLE:* If you read this blog using RSS, switch to
 the new RSS feed at [[https://cestlaz.zamansky.net/rss.xml][https://cestlaz.zamansky.net/rss.xml]]. I think the
 old feed still works.

 Finally, could somebody leave and/or reply to a comment here - I
 think I switched those over correctly but would love to test it out.

 Thanks
 Mike
