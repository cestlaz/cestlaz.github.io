Time for another SIGCSE - the big Computer Science Education
conference. This time in St. Louis.

This is something like my 10th SIGCSE and the fourth I've attended
with my daughter who's in her first year as a grad student, pursuing
her PhD in CS with a focus on education.

At this point, I think she knows more people here than I do.

Actually, that was something I was thinking about. While I have my
share of friends here at the conference, I know far fewer people. Back
when I started, I knew most of the teams from Google, GitHub, TEALS,
Microsoft, all of which had large representation. Also, there were
more people from that CS4All efforts that I interacted with.

Between all of those people not being here anymore and retirements, I
feel somewhat less connected.

I guess that's just the circle of life - I'm on the retirement phase
while youngsters like my daughter are on the upswing.

A goal of mine, however is to be a co-author on a paper here with
her one of these days and I'm still enjoying the conference very much.

As usual, I'll write about the conference sessions, keynotes, and BOFs
but since the conference is still going on as I write, I'll focus on
the conference and St. Louis today.

First off, St. Louis doesn't seem to do healthy food :-). The food's
been great at the conference but not too many healthy choices. That's
not a complaint mind you - I'm really enjoying the food and it's just
a few days - like on a vacation. Just an observation.

Now, on the food - the logistics have been impeccable. Best SIGCSE
ever. At every break and at the reception they've had sufficient
stations and they keep them filled. No lines at all. I've been really
impressed. They also have had coffee, tea, and hot chocolate (with
marshmallows and sprinkles if you like) available before the start of
each day.

Well done SIGCSE.

We did a couple of touristy things before the conference started - we
went to the zoo and up the Arch (the picture is from my foggy run
early in the morning) - both cool but the highlight was
visiting the Cathedral. It was really magnificient. Right up there
with all the other great houses of worship, even the Sagrada Familia
which we just visited a few weeks ago.

We also spent some time with a friend of Devorah's who warned us about
safety. Don't go north or south too many blocks from the hotel and on
and on. We figured, whatever - we're New Yorkers - we'll do our
usual - be aware of your surroundings, walk confident, etc.

At the conference though, for the first time in my memory, they showed
a slide about safety - don't wear your badge outside, walk in groups,
take ride shares.

I haven't felt unsafe, but maybe the part of St. Louis we're in isn't
so safe.

I wanted to also hit the City Museum and the Blues museum but the City
Museum was closed on my one tourist day and the Blues museum closed to
early.

I'll have more to say about the conference overall but since we're mid
day two I'll hold off on that until the end.

Next couple of posts though will focus on the sessions, keynotes, and
BOFS.
