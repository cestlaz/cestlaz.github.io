Next three days were in Bologna.

Highlight was getting dinner with former student and friend Paul who
is now living in Modena and working for the Ferrari Formula 1 racing
team - how cool is that. I also realized over dinner that I've known
Paul now for over 20 years - man, I'm getting old.

Bologna's usually a few degrees cooler than Rome but overall the
mercury kept rising so outside wasn't particularly comfortable.

On the plus side, all the streets in the center city have porticos and
this helped a lot.  There was almost always a shady side of the street
where it felt much cooler. I was still dripping with sweat all day but
the porticos definitely helped.

For me, other than the food (which I could also say for Rome), the
highlight was probably the Basilica di Santo Stefano. It's what I'd
call a Frankenbuilding, that is a building made from multiple
buildings. I always found those pretty neat. Seems that there are a
lot of bookstores that are Frankenbuildings - Powell's in Portland,
City Lights in San Fran, and E. Shavers in Savanah. Even the old and
now closed main branch of Barnes and Nobles on fifth avenue in New
York was two buildigns smooshed together.

In this case it started as one church and over the years, additional
churches were stitched (built) on. Really fascinating.

There was also a little museum.

We also visited the Basilica di San Petronio which boasts the worlds
largest sundial that's basically a line with markings running from the
entrance to the altar area.

This was in the city's main square. Also on the square is the 
 Salaborsa Library , under which there are some neat ruins.

An Neptune.

We were told by a local that Maserati trident logo was taken from this
statue.

A short walk away was one of the original buildings from the
University of Bologna - the oldest continuously operating university
in the world where we saw an original operating theater and a room
where Rossini premiered one of his works.

To round out our trip, we also visited their Jewish museum, their museum of music which had
interesting instruments, old scores, and more as well as the Museo
Davia Bargellini which was a cool little free museum featuring
"industrial art."

Super hot but a good few days.

Now off to the Rossini festival in Pesaro.
