Still stuck in St. Louis and still haven't finished my SIGCSE series
but there have been a few threads in the various CS Education groups
about the big changes in code.org and how AI might be making learning
CS the way we've been teaching it obsolete.

Rubbish and here's a couple of stories as to why.

Let's go back to the start of this century. 9/11 had just placed
America into a state of shock. I was home and I heard from a former
student - one who graduated in '96. I'll call him Steve since I can't
check to see if he's okay with me revealing his identity until later.

Steve knew that Stuy was right near the Twin Towers so he wanted to
check to see if I was okay after the traumatic events. I also asked
how he was doing. It turned out he was in Texas. Since graduating
college he had joined the Blackstone group. He was working on the
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enron_scandal][Enron thing]]. If you don't remember or are too young to know, check out
the link. This was a big, complicated mess. Enron owned a huge number
of companies and the debt and ownership relationships were nuts.

My guy Steve was the only junior guy on the team. The rest?
Experienced business people with MBAs and tons of experience and
similarly experienced people with doctorates in Economics or
similar. I forget what Steve's major was in college but he both
studied CS with me at Stuyvesant and also knew a bunch more from self
study.

Now, forgive me but my memory is a little fuzzy. I forget if what he
told me was what he already did or if it unfolded over the next few
weeks and then I got the update but the gist is the same. I'll go with
the assumption that the events I'm going to share here had already happened.

I asked him how they were going to deal with the situation. Steve
said that after a considerable amount of time, all the senior team
members were stumped on any quick resolution an figured they'd be
down in Texas for months trying to figure things out and even then,
they weren't sure.

My guy had different plans. He went back to his hotel room, took out
his laptop, wrote up some code and a short time later, well, maybe not
as short as now since computers and specifically laptops were slower
back then, problem solved and Steve was written up in some Wall Street
publication as the next "Wall Street Wiz Kid!"

The thing is, Steve looked at the problem through the lens of a
computer scientist.

Now, you might say - but now with AI, anyone could just ask for the
solution. Nonsense - back then, all those senior people could have
come up with a solution and then grabbed a programmer to implement it

The key was that Steve could think and problem solve from a computer
scientists point of view and that gave him the edge. All the AI in the
world wouldn't have helped that Blackstone team had Steve - the guy
who could think and problem solve like a computer scientist was not on
the team.

Fast forward another ten or so years. I was talking to another former
student. He was a lawyer. Attended Harvard Law and was now at a
powerful law firm.

Randomly during out chat, he said, "You know, the most important class
I ever took to prepare me was your intro CS class." I was a little
surprised. That was the 10th grade class that used Racket and NetLogo
as implementation languages but I always thought the class was more
about thinking and problem solving than about just programming.

He said that both now professionally and during law school, he had an
edge. Everyone in his classes and his firm could think like a lawyer
but he could also approach problems like a computer scientist.

That's the win.

Over the years I've heard this again and again from my students who
haven't gone into tech. I've also heard from the ones in tech how the
value of that and other classes I've taught were not just about the
language and the vocation of programming but of thinking and problem
solving.

Of course I didn't reach everyone in this way - I've also had students
who just feel that "you taught me Java" but that's okay.

The importance of teaching CS if we teach it right is the thinking and
the problem solving. Programming can continue to be a tool to develop
these skills in young minds and AI can and will be incorporated in the
process. The kids who's teachers and schools get the mix right will be
at a big advantage to those that don't.

So, don't let the naysayers diminish the value of our field. We've got
to advocate for why CS is just as important as it ever was if not more
so.

Code.org will do whatever Code.org does. So will the College Board and
CSTA. They might make great choices for our field or they might make
horrible ones. As teachers, it's our job to continue to advocate for
what's right for our kids.
