Time to reboot the blog.

Why? Because of my new tablet.

So, I got a new tablet a week or so ago. A Oneplus Pad 2. It's a 12"
android tablet. I really only use it in the mornings in the winter and
inclement weather. I use it with my Wahoo bike trainer both to run the
trainer controls and to watch videos. In nice weather I usually run
outside.

This particular tablet has a pretty cheap add on keyboard so I
thought, if I get the keyboard, it could be a lightweight travel
laptop replacement. It's already good for media consumption and it can
also run ssh so I can connect to a remote computer and do more serious
work as well as things like write blog posts when traveling.

So, I went to a DigitalOcean droplet - a Linux box in the cloud,
cloned my blog and installed Hugo - my blog generator, and the go
language.

It didn't work. It turns out that the custom theme I downloaded had
issues with the current version of Hugo and the older version of Hugo
I was running had issues running under the current version of
Go. Serves me right for not keeping on top of things since I moved my
blog to Hugo in 2018 and updated the theme in  2020.

So, it was time for a reboot. Still using Hugo but a new but similar
theme. I linked to the older versions of my blog in the menu up
top. I'll probably also clean things up over the next few weeks but
already the new theme has the Bluesky link up top to replace Twitter
which I ditched months ago.

Even though blogging seems to be dying I'll probably continue writing
on CS with some Emacs mixed in and probably expand the range of topics
a bit since now, in retirement I'm not so immersed in CS Education.

We'll see where things go from here.
