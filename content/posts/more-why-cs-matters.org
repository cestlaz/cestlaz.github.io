I wanted to follow up on my earlier post on [[https://cestlaz.zamansky.net/posts/why-cs-still-matters/][why teaching CS still matters]].

In that post, I cited a couple of former students. Not only former
students but particularly high achieving ones. One friend commented on
that - the idea that my thesis may makes sense for those high
achievers but not everyone.

I maintain that CS, if taught right is still important for all
students.

It's about thinking and problem solving and that exploring programming
can help build those thinking and problem solving skills.

Let's look at a couple of other situations to illustrate the point.

A number of years ago I was talking to yet another student - yes,
another super high achiever. This one was a math whiz. We're talking
IMO level. Some time after working with a number of other top young
math minds from other countries we were talking about his experiences.

He noted, that in his experience, in the USA, the primary prolem
solving appraoch that was taught was algebra based. This was his
and his friend's experience in New York and also what he saw from
other top young American mathematicians. In contrast, he noticed that
the mathematicians he got to know from other countries were more
likely to take other approaches to solving problems - a geometrical
one for example.

Kids across the world learn math but aparently, in different
locations, with different foci, the kids end up approaching problems
differently - thinking differently.

A number of years later, my chairman - math chair, went to an Eastern
European country for a few weeks to learn about how they taught high
school math. Her takeaways was that they don't do nearly as much as we
do in terms of topics but they dive much deeper into what they do and
not as much of a focus on Algebra, which we treast as a major piece
pretty much every high school class.

This supports my student's experience.

Now, I'm not arguing that one way is better than the other, though my
gut says that doing less to more depth is probably better than our
current high school math progression, it's that, yes, we're trying to
teach math, but we're really trying to teach them to think.

The calculator didn't make math education obsolete but people are
quick to note that the calculator to math isn't the same as generative
AI to CS. It isn't but there have been computer tools available to do
everything through high school math and well beyond and none of those
made high school math obsolete.

I'll finish this post with one more thought. Generative AI won't make
CS Education any less important but it should force us to re-examine
what we do and how we're doing it.

We want to focus on building thinkers but we can look at the past for
an example of just that done wrong.

High school geometry.

It's called geometry but, at least in my opinion, it really isn't
about geometry at all. It's a course in deductive reasoning, problem
solvin and logic using Euclidean Geometry as the platform to explore
said reasoning.

Unfortuantely, in most implementations that part is lost. It first
became a course in the basics of Euclidean Geometry and then, in many
cases devolved into a course in algebraic aspects of Euclidean
Geometry.

Missed opportunity.

I know that in some pockets, CS teachers will do better. I'm confident
that the home grown classes at Stuy will stand the test of time and
I know some other teachers at other schools who, if given the
opportunity will create great experiences for their students.

The question is, what will the gorillas in the room do - the College
Board, code.org and the outher outsized influencers.
