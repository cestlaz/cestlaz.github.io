Over a month since my last post. Wow.

Anyway, last week was full of Artificial Intelligence events. On
Wednesday, I attended a talk by Ray Kurzweil, hosted by Trinity High
School - a posh private school on the Upper West Side, The Academy for
Teachers, and Teach for America. Thursday was a StuyCS event which was
really about early stage startups but much of the discussion revolved
around AI and Friday was a meeting of CUNY CS educators where the
topic of the day was, of course, AI - I was there
to pitch, well, [[https://pitchfest.github.io/][Pitchfest]].

All three were great but I wanted to write about the Kurzweil talk.

The talk was supposed to be about AI and the future of education but
he really didn't share any deep thoughts on the subject. He did,
however bring up some topics that made me think about a number of
issues.

A big part of the talk involved Kurzweil talking about what he
described as our biological brain and our other, external brain - that
being what we have access to via our phones or other computing
devices. The example he gave multiple times was that we might be
thinking of an actor and forgot who they were but we can easily use
our phone to look them up which, in a way, increases our intelligence
over us, say 30 years ago.

Kurzweil predicts that by some time next decade we'll have achieved
Artificial General Intelligence and in fact our biological brain will
be directly connected to our "external brain." Then, if we're asked
about that actor we'll just be able to give the answer instantly. We
won't even know if the answer came from the biological brain or the
other one.

It will have made us smarter.

Or did it?

This was the big question I was left with.

I was catching up with an old high school buddy and was relaying this
to him and he hit the nail on the head. He said "or at least we'll
have more knowledge."

Does knowing more stuff actually make us smarter?

It's an interesting question.

Years ago, a few of us at Stuy were talking about two particular
students. Both very smart by any reasonable measure and in fact both
were individual standouts. There was a big difference between them
though. One student knew a lot - had a lot of information. Had a great
memory, read tons of books, could produce formula after formula on
demand and so forth. The other didn't have nearly as much information
at the ready but was stronger at figuring things out. The first
student would just know the theorem, the second would derive it.

Who was "smarter?"

We mostly felt the one who was the stronger problem solver was
"smarter" than the one with more knowledge.

So how does it play out with AI?

Will all that knowledge make us smarter?

We'll "know" all the formulas but will we know when to use them? Will
knowing all the chords make me a better composer? Knowledge of color
theory a better artist?

It also raises the question of how the information will exist and be
"communicated" to our brain. Right now most of the information we
interface with is textual - word based descriptions. Will textual
knowledge translate to non textual concepts?

How does this play against things like Synesthesia where some people
might "see" music as colors or "smell" scents for shapes.

I don't have any answers here but these are questions that go well
beyond the already interesting and challenging questions of students
using LLMs.

Of course, those LLM questions came up during the second part of the
talk. That was something of a reverse panel where three guests - one,
a representative from Math for America, one from the Academy for
Teachers, and one form Trinity asked Kurzweil questions.

Another question that came up during that panel part made me
chuckle. It was raised by the Trinity representative - I think she was
head of school. She went on about he strong belief in equity and
diversity and ended with concerns about AI - could it be an equalizer.

I chuckled because the person who was asking the question hold a
position that in spite of statements to the contrary is very much
about maintaining separation between the "elite" and everyone else. I
mean, a high school that has an annual tuition of over $60,000 isn't
really working for the common man. The person she was asking, Ray
Kurzweil, on the other hand was a product of New York City public
schools. Martin Van Buren high school specifically.

Chuckles aside, it's an important question and I didn't agree with the
answer. Kurzweil addressed the audience noting that they all had
phones and that having a phone was not a big deal financially. As I
looked around, I noted that the audience was mostly white, mostly well
dressed, and apparently largely affluent.

Sadly, the digital divide is still real and I don't see things getting
better with AI.

In any event, I really enjoyed the evening and it did leave me
thinking about things.

I know that we're all thinking about AI as educators. I wonder if
others are also thinking about the types of issues I was left thinking
about after Kurzweil's talk.
