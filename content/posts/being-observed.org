following up on my last post, let's dive in to being oberved as a
model for teacher improvement and teacher evaluation. Next time we'll
look at the flip side - teachers observing for improvement.

As I mentioned last time, I'm writing about New York City public
schools but would be interested in hearing what things are like in
other locations and other types of institutions.

Evaluation *and* improvement - that's the line but it's rarely the
case. It's almost never really about teacher improvement and for
evaluation, well, boxes are checked and contracts fulfilled but I'm
not convinced that even in evaluation, they do more than that.

I recently saw someone post a comment about observaitons noting that
"as long as your administration is reasonable or better, they're not
really a big deal."

I think this is accurate and we'll see why soon but there are cases
where observations are weaponized.

My first chairman absolutely loved me. I was a solid young teacher but
he treated me like I was the greatest thing since Betty White. He even
wrote up in one of my evaluations "this lesson was a perfect as a
lesosn could be" which was patently wrong - it was a solid lesson and
I daresay a really good "delivered by a beginner" lesson but it was
nowhere near perfect.

The problem with that chair though was that there were other teachers
he didn't like at all, including a couple of my mentors and friends. I
remember one morning in the Math office when he commented to me on the
way out, "I'm going to get Bob today." Bob being a stand in name for
the real teacher's name. The implication was that he was going to go
in to observe him with the plan of writing up a bad report.

This really scarred me. I taught for over thirty years and was
observed countless time. I *never* received  a bad writeup in all that
time, although once, in those early years, that chair came into my
classroom, saw it was "one of those days" and noped right out since he
liked me, but for all my time as a teacher, I always tightened up when
my supervisor came in.

Now, I say I never received a bad writeup but not all my observed
lessons were winners. Early on when at Stuy, I was observed in a
couple of "meh" lessons but my chairman there, Richard Rothenberg was
much gentler. He honestly tried to make it about teacher improvement
and just really liked watching his teachers teach. One lesson, I was
just severely underestimating my classes potential and Richie gently
nudged me along while really working hard to not make me feel bad
about it. Another time, he felt that my lesson could be enriched with
outside materials and that led to an ongoing conversation about math
enrichment and context materials and I became a better teacher for it.

Still, I would always freeze up.

Getting back to why observations don't work for either evaluation or
improvement, let's start with the burden on the observer.

In a small high school of about 100 kids per grade, give or take,
you'll have around 17 teachers - probably more like 20. When I was
teaching high school, everyone was observed 6 times a semester though
if you were tenured, 4 of the 6 would be partial period rather than
full.

That's over 100 observations.

That same small school has one principal and one assistant principal,
maybe a second AP but they probably also have more than 20 teachers
anyway so let's say 1 principal and 1 AP. There are typically 180
school days each year so that's over 1 observation a day.

Oh, did I mention that every observation has a post ob conference and
the full period observations are supposed to have a pre observation
conference though that seems to rarely happen.

Then, when it's all done, the supervisor has to write it all up.

Now, don't forget that the principal and AP also have other
responsibilities like, oh, I don't know, running the school in general
and dealing with every emergency that comes up.

On top of that, in a small school, the likelihood is that the
supervisor isn't going to know much about the subject they're
observing.

Is it any surprise that this model fails in terms of teacher
improvement and is, in schools with "reasonable or better"
administrations pretty much box checking lip service.

The other major problem with the observation model is that it's a
snapshot without context. I've heard that some teachers, in schools
with bad admins have an "observation" lesson ready to go and when the
supervisor came in, that lesson would come out.

I actually sort of did this but not really.

NYC DOE at one point started using the Danielson Framework for
observations. As a teacher evaluation tool, it's garbage. Even
Danielson has repeatedly said this (and she kept saying it all the way
to the bank). The Framework has dozens of areas of expertise that
teachers are supposed to exhibit. Far too many to keep track of so our
school decided on a subset that supervisors would look for as
check boxes for observations.

Well, to start, think about how ridiculous that is - what if I teach a
great lesson that emphasizes the other areas of Danielson's framework?
If that happened, my lesson would be unsatisfactory. I was actually
talking to a colleague once and she said she hated the framework. I
asked why since what they were looking for fit this teacher like a
glove. She replied - it's only a matter of time until they change it
and then I'll all of a sudden be a bad teacher. 

In any event, I had a great chairman and we'd have an unspoken game
we'd play when I was observed. We both knew my lesson would be fine so
my chair would look for one or two Danielson points to "ding" me on
and I'd try to cover them all while hiding one or two so they weren't
obvious.

It was all in good fun.

One year, one of the categories was redirecting a student question to
another student. During the post ob, my chair pointed out that I
didn't cover that. Now I forget what I did, but I did something
convoluted to hide it but specifically put in an instance of
redirecting a student question to another question. I pointed it
out. I won that round. I list others but again, this was a game we
played.

The truth is, we also spoke about the lesson in general and that was
valuable. We did the Danielson nonsense because the DOE required it
but then we just talked shop.

And that actually brings me back to the beginning. The entire model is
horribly flawed so is mostly just a check off in a decent school and
unfortunately, a weapon in a bad one but for all the money spent and
wasted on Danielson and refining how teachers are observed, my first
chairman gave me guidance that I always tried to follow.

He understood that all sorts of lessons can be good and can be
bad. One of my colleagues was big on cooperative learning so that's
how he framed most lessons. That didn't work so well for me so while I
might incorporate some "cooperative learning" concepts, by lessons
would look very different.  He said that when observing you just have
to ask "is learning happening." And then as the observer you have to
figure out where and why. If you can't you discuss that with the
teacher.

Simple but it's always served me well.

It was reinforced very late in my career. I was talking to my current
principal and they were talking about a certain legendary
teacher. They commented "I can never bring any DOE officials into his
class because we all know he's one of the best teachers in the school
but he doesn't do things the way they expect them to be done."

I'll finish off with a couple of observation alternatives that existed
when I started teaching but seemed to fall to the wayside. They may
still exist in other schools but I just don't know.

One was the video observation. For one of my three each semester, I
was allowed to video tape a lesson (yes, it was tape back then), watch
it, then watch it again with my supervisor for the official
observation.

That took more time but it was actually pretty valuable if you could
get over the cringe inducing moments when rewatching the lesson for
the official part.

The other was that we could do a peer observation for one of each
three. I'd first conference with a colleague, we'd then observe each
other, conference again with each other and then finally all meet with
the supervisor for an official debriefing.

This was also really good but took much more time and coordination was
tough.

So that's being observed in NYC public schools. Like I said at the
top, I'd love to hear what's done elsewhere and if it's any better for
either improvement or evaluation.

Next up, we'll talk about teachers observing other teachers for
improvement - the thing that Mark's initial post was really about that
got me started on this rabbit hole.
