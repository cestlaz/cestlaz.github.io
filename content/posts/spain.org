Taking time out from my observation blog posts to write up a trip report.

For the past few winters, Devorah and I have been trying to spend a
few days somewhere warmer. Not necessarily warm, but warmer.

We've done San Diego twice then Charleston and last year Savannah. We
were thinking of New Orleans this time around but we're going there
for the CSTA conference in July so started looking around. It turned
out that air fairs to Spain, specifically to Madrid or Barcelona were
ridiculously inexpensive and hotels were also pretty affordable. Going
to Europe was actually going to be a good site cheaper than travelling
domestically so we booked the flights.

Five days in Barcelona and five in Madrid with a day trip to Toledo.

Got tons of great recs from former students and friends and this post
will be the highlights. Partly to share and partly so that I have a
memory.

Besides the price, Spain checked the boxes. Barcelona was supposed to
be low 40s going into the upper 50s most days and Madrid around 5
degrees cooler. According to my research, each usually gets 4 days of
rain in January.

Unfortunately, we got all of them :-(.

It threatened rain every day we were there and rained most of
them. Fortunately, the rain really didn't hinder our trip and we still
had a great time.

* Barcelona

We stayed at the [[https://oriente.atiramhotels.com/en/][Oriente Atiram hotel]] on Las Ramblas which is in a
historic building and has a beautiful atrium. 

After checking in we spent most of the first afternoon wandering
around in the rain. Over the next few days we toured La Sagrada
Familia and Park Guell - two of the architect [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoni_Gaud%C3%AD][Antonio Gaudi]]'s  most
famous works and walked by a number of his others. Both were as
magnificent as advertised and well worth the visit.

Two of the architectural highlights though weren't by Gaudi. One was
[[https://santpaubarcelona.org/][Sant Pau Recine Modernista]] - a complex that was formerly a
hospital. Amazing site and really interesting both from the
architecture and the history of the hospital and hospitals in
general. The other was the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palau_de_la_M%C3%BAsica_Catalana][Palau de la Musica Catalana]] - an amazing
concert hall. We visited but unfortunately, nothing was playing that
interested us during our time in Barcelona. Both of these sites were
designed by Lluís Domènech i Montaner.

We also visited the Picasso museum, Miro foundation, a couple of
smaller museums and even found a small museum in what was an old
Jewish Synagogue. 

Food was also dynomite. We hit one place for paella but mostly did
Tapas. I was a little concerned with dining since they eat much later
than we do. I thought we'd either have to totally shift our schedule
or we'd just get bad tourist food. It actually worked out fine. We for
the most part ate a little later but still earlier than most locals
but as long as we were off the main tourist drags and squares we
seemed to do fine.

In fact, one particular place - probably our best
meal in Barcelona, our early dining worked for us. It was [[https://www.bodega-biarritz.es/a-propos/][Bodega
Biarritsz]] where they had a fixed tapas meal - 45 euros for 2 people or
55 for two with an extra course of local cured meats and
cheese. I looked to see if they took resrvations and their site said
no and if you didn't want to wait, come off hours, specifically
between 2:00pm and 6:30pm - score!!!!!

** Toledo

We did a day trip to Toledo from Madrid. There was enough in Madrid so
we could have spent plenty more days without venturing out but Toledo
had some Jewish stuff and we always like exploring our heritage when
travelling even if we're technically of Ashkenazi decent and Spanish
Jews would be Sophardic.

We visited one Synagogue/museum from the 1400s and another that was
first a synagogue and then a Catholic church that dates back
to 1205. That older synagogue interestingly enough was also designed
by Muslims.

We also hit few other interesting Jewish historic sites and some
Catholic ones as well not to mention a quick stop in the El Greco
museum.

I found it interesting that on the one hand, prior to the trip I saw a
fair amount of materials talking about Toledo as a center for the
three major Abrahamic religions with an implied veneer of equality. It
was nice to see that once there, the history wasn't whitewashed with
references to Jews living under Islamic law as Dhimmis - second class
citizens and the expulsion of the Jews from Spain in 1492 by Spain's
Catholic royalty.

Our Toledo visit was our rainiest day but I 100% recommend. If we get
back to the region, we'll probably return to Toledo for another day
since there are still a few things I want to see.

* Madrid 

Madid was also pretty terrific. We skipped the Prado - Madrid's
largest and most famous art museum and decided to hit the other two of
Madrid's big three - the Reina Sofía and the Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza.

We did something similar when we went to Paris for a couple of days on
a trip last year - skipped the Louvre but hit the Musee d'Orsay and a
couple of others.

The collections and exhibits at the Riena Sofia and the
Thyssen-Bornemisra were more in line in what we're currently enjoying.

I think we made the right decision. Devorah really wanted to see
Picasso's Guernica so we hit that first at the Riena Sofia.

It wasn't too crowded so we could get both up close and distance views
to really take it in. I also loved that they had information on it's
development and images of themes that never made it into the
composition.

The physical viewing was a stark contrast to when we were at the
Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam last year and saw "The Night Watch." It wa
covered in glass and you couldn't really get up to it (though a year
before, when I was there with Batya you could).

Overall the museum was great but I think I liked the
Thyssen-Bornemisra even better. The main exhibit was set up
chronologically starting with rooms full of fourteenth century mostly
religous works. As you go through the museum you move through time,
later visiting a room full of Hudson River School paintings, also
impressionists, and up to more modern works.

We also visited the Royal Palace which was impressive and various
other sites around town.

Of course, lots of great food.

Just as we found one particularly terrific restaurant in Barcelona we
also did the same in Madrid. We originally set out for a place that
looked good on Google maps but when we got to the address there was no
restaurant to be found.

We ended up a few blocks down at what maps to this place - [[https://www.google.com/maps/place/En+Busca+del+Tiempo/@40.4155767,-3.7025883,21z/data=!4m14!1m7!3m6!1s0xd42288080dc07f3:0x581949e25fe7583d!2sEn+Busca+del+Tiempo!8m2!3d40.4156437!4d-3.7026768!16s%2Fg%2F12qf91qkx!3m5!1s0xd42288080dc07f3:0x581949e25fe7583d!8m2!3d40.4156437!4d-3.7026768!16s%2Fg%2F12qf91qkx?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI2MDIwMy4wIKXMDSoKLDEwMDc5MjA3M0gBUAM%3D][En Busca
del Tiempo]] though the menu online doesn't match at all what we saw and
what we had.

We were given Spanish only menus but muddled through. Ordered three
dishes - one tapa - a mushroom dish, what they had listed as a "snack"
(based on Google translate) - Prawns braised in cider on rice and a
meat dish. Way too much food but each dish was sublime.

We had to go back the following night because we wanted to try their
paella. Our waited recognized us and took good care of us. His English
was far better than our Spanish so we managed to have a nice chat and
at the end we were comped an extra. Definately going back next time
we're in town.

So that was ou January in Spain trip.

Great time in spite of the rain.

Thanks to all my friends who helped guide us in making our intenerary.

Next time, we'll dive back in to observations - teachers observing
each other.
