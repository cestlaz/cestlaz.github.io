We basically finished up our trip in Pesaro, a resort town on the
Adriatic Sea. Well, there plus one final day in Rome before our flight
home.

Why Pesaro? Seaside resorts aren't usually our speed. Well, Pesaro is
the birthplace of composer [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gioachino_Rossini][Gioachino Rossini]] and hosts an annual
Rossini festival. Now, I like Opera but I wouldn't travel across an
ocean to see some Rossini so how did we end up there? It's Natan's
fault. This year was the first year since graduating Michigan when
he's been able to take a real vacation. We decided we wanted to do a
family thing and since he's had the fewest opportunities to travel
gave him the choice.

He, being a Rossini fan, decided he'd love to attend the festival. We
built the trip around that. Unfortunately, as the planning progressed
it turned out we weren't able to do a whole family thing since Batya
had to be up in Illinois to start grad school concurrent with the
festival. Still, a great trip.

As Rossini's birthplace, Pesaro has a Rossini museum and you can tour
his birthplace. Both very interesting even if you're not big on
Rossini or opera.

Beyond that we didn't do too much touring.

We did go down to the Adriatic where we found this sculpture:

It reminded me of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sphere][World Trade Center Sphere]] crushed on 9/11 that
was on display outside of Stuy for a while until it was relocated to a
permanent home in Battery Park. Any similarity though was just
coincidence as the Globe in Pesaro was created and installed years
prior.

Also, in spite of my persistent hip issues, I did get a run in early
by the sea:

And another highlight was yet another Church - the Cattedrale di Santa
Maria Assunta. A thirteenth century church built on top of a sixth century Basilica which itself was
built atop a fourth century Roman Basilica. The cool thing was that
part of the floor is exposed to show the extensive mosaic work on the
earlier floors.

For the festival, I saw two operas, Zelmira and L'Italiana in Algeri
(The Italian in Algeria).

I enjoyed both but Zelmira, being a production in the round (in a
modern space) detracted from the performance. If you want a deep dive
into both productions and the festival in general, check out Natan's
[[https://seccorecit.substack.com/p/review-rossini-opera-festival-2025][blog]].

L'Italiana in Algeri was staged in the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teatro_Rossini_(Pesaro)][Teatro Rossini]], an 1818 old
school opera house.

Really fun opera and production and great performances and it was a
trip to see it in an old school venue. For details, again I refer you
to [[https://seccorecit.substack.com/p/review-rossini-opera-festival-2025][Natan's blog]].

The downside of the Pesaro part of the trip is that we were well into
holiday season so even more restaurants were closed. Combine that with
Italians eating later (most restaurants didn't open until 7:00 or
7:30) and the operas starting at 7:00 or 8:00 made dinners a
challenge. That said, we did have some good food including a terrific
no frills seafood place for one of our lunches.

From Pesaro we were back to Rome for a day before our flight. There we
checked out two more sites.

First was the Vittoriano and the Museum of the Risorgimento
within. THe Vittoriano is a monument to Vittorio Emanuele II, the
first king of unified Italy and is really impressive inside and
out. The museum was really cool telling the tale of Italy's
unification.

Our final official stop was the Capitoline museum, right next door
although we had to walk down the hill and right back up. Of course,
every time I read "Capitoline Museum" I hear Samuel L. Jackson saying
"what's in your wallet?"

On the Capitline Hill, the museum (or collection of museums)
is an archaeological museum with artifacts from ancient (Greek) times
through the Renaissance. Highligths include Marcus Aurelius on a
horse, a bust of Medusa by Bernini. and much much more.

After that, we had our last dinner (last supper?) and then the next
day, back home.

Great trip, now to plan the next one.
