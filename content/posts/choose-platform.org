In my [[/posts/blog-reboot-2025/][Blog Reboot]] post I talked about blogging being a fading
pastime. Over at [[https://irreal.org/blog/?p=12744][Irreal]], JCS responded that his experience says
otherwise and that his RSS feeds in fact experiencing a rebirth.

Both can be true. I've also seen an increase in what are essentially
bogs - more people on Substack and the like - I regularly read Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar's [[https://kareem.substack.com/p/police-union-furious-over-trumps][substack]] as well as others. On the other hand, there's
clearly been a dropoff in CS Education related blogging and also less
dialog on the blogs that are around.

Part of what led me to my blogging is dying side comment is something
that I've been thinking about a lot recently which is our choice of
platforms.
