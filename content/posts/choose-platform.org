In my [[/posts/blog-reboot-2025/][Blog Reboot]] post I talked about blogging being a fading
pastime. Over at [[https://irreal.org/blog/?p=12744][Irreal]], JCS responded that his experience says
otherwise and that his RSS feeds in fact experiencing a rebirth.

Both can be true. I've also seen an increase in what are essentially
bogs - more people on Substack and the like - I regularly read Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar's [[https://kareem.substack.com/p/police-union-furious-over-trumps][substack]] as well as others. On the other hand, there's
clearly been a dropoff in CS Education related blogging and also less
dialog on the blogs that are around.

Part of what led me to my blogging is dying side comment is something
that I've been thinking about a lot recently which is our choice of
platforms.

The most active CS Ed communities I'm aware of live on Facebook. I've
always felt that Facebook was a problematic platform. It's a closed
silo. I'm not talking about the fact that groups are controlled by
their respective admins. The CS Ed groups, by and large seem to have
reasonable ones. I'm talking about the Facebook platform. The groups
are not discoverable from the outside and while searchable, only from
within each individal group. If Meta decides to change policies, the
group or groups might go away, all data is lost and all membership is
lost.

Contrast that with what I use for my StuyCS family (or Mafia as some
call it). That's just a mailing list. The entire email archive is
stored online but can be downloaded at any time and even if the
provider closes up shop, I've got all the email addresses and can
restart elsewhere. Of course, a mailing list has it's own limitations
but that's another discussion.

While I've been concerned about Facebook for a while, Zuck's most
current actions makes me even more disturbed about using it. While I
can't speak for the entire CS Ed community, certainly the subset on
the Facebook platform seem pretty concerned with DEI, equity, and the
like. Well, we know what Zuck did there. Then there's also the fact
checking.

Maybe as a community we should walk the walk and not just talk the
talk.

Personally I've been spending less time on Facebook in general. Other
than the CS Ed and a couple of other communities I'm finding it less
useful. It used to be great to keep in touch with a subset of former
students. The ones that I might not be close enough with to have an
ongoing connection but still enough to care to see updates and send a
hello now and the. Well, more and more, those people are opting off
the platform, or at least the algorihtm isn't sharing there stuff as
much and just giving me algorithm generated garbage.

Of course, one needs alternatives. It would be great to see a CS Ed
blogging rennaisance but that's dependent on both creaters to create
and readers to comment.

CSTA has forums  but their platform is slow and clunky and I think it
might only be for CSTA+ members. If that's true, I don't like the
exclusivity. Reddit's a much better platform technically but is also
its own silo.

Oh for the days of usenet news. a set of cs.education.* newsgroups
would be just perfect.

SIGCSE has some mailing lists and those are easy to set up but I just
don't think another mailing list would gain traction.

To be consistent I want to point out that I'm not just down on
Facebook. I'm also looking to degoogle. Their capitulating on The Gulf
of America so quickly might have been my last straw with them.

I'm heading to Savannah next week for a little vacation but when I get
back I'll probably switch over to Fastmail.

Then for me there's also GitHub. I've already moved most of my git
based work to GitLab but this blog still lives at github.io. When I
get back from down south, I'll also probably move that to another
domain.

Of course everyone has to keep their own concience but I do really
think that as a community of educators, particularly one that claims
that equity and diversity is important, we should be thinking long and
hard about the platforms we use and the products we support.
