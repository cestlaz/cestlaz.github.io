History is a funny thing.

They say it's written by the victors but even when the "good guys"
win, the history taught is often, let's say, incomplete.

Back in school we'd learn about all sorts of feel good American
equality stuff but how many learned about Black Wall Street and the
Tusla Race Massacre?

I've knew about the Green Book and Sundown Towns years before the
"Green Book" movie and was shocked when I did learn about the towns,
how recently they've existed and how many existed up [[https://justice.tougaloo.edu/sundown-towns/using-the-sundown-towns-database/state-map/][up north]].

I didn't know, though until recently that the Green Book was modelled
after [[https://merrimackvalleyhavurah.wordpress.com/2022/02/08/the-jewish-vacation-guide-a-response-to-american-antisemitism/][The Jewish Vacation Guide]] - a similar publication but to combat
antisemitism and published a decade or so earlier.

It's bad enough that we've been taught a false and rosy history of our
country but it's getting worse.

Under the current administration, history, particulary the history of
marginalized groups is being erased. Most recently, the LGBTQ+ flag
from Stonewall but the erasure is widespread and rather frightening.

A friend of mine is part of a group leveraging
tech to try to save history from erasure. In this case, specifically
Black history.

The project is [[https://unerasable.org/][Unerasable]].

The project is leveraging various tech and technologies and they're
looking for help.

I'm sharing what my friend sent me below and if you're interested,
drop me a line and I can connect you (or you can sign up on the site).

I wanted to share a project that started from a very personal place.

After reading about the removal of slavery exhibits from national
parks and other public spaces, I was heartbroken — and angry. As a
father, I realized that on our trip to Philadelphia next week, I
couldn't be sure what of our history would still be there to
experience. So I started Unerasable with some community builders I
work with.

Unerasable is a decentralized public archive that uses 3D scanning,
blockchain, and immersive tech to document and preserve historical
spaces and exhibits before they’re removed or altered. We just
launched our V1 site here and had our first team meeting this month —
and now I’m reaching out to you all because we need technical
collaborators.

Here’s how you can help:

 1. 3D + Photogrammetry – We need folks who can advise on or
    contribute to high-quality, accessible capture (from phone LiDAR
    to pro gear).

 2. Blockchain – We're looking for tech sponsors or devs to help us
    log provenance data (timestamped capture info, version history) in
    a decentralized, durable way.

 3. XR / Immersive – We're designing a lightweight web experience
    where users can return to erased spaces. If you’ve worked in AR/VR
    or WebXR, we’d love your input or help building that layer.

This project is open-source in spirit, urgent in mission, and deeply
personal. If you’re interested in helping, collaborating, or
connecting us to people in your networks — I’d love to talk.

Even with all the bad going on right now, it's heartening that there
are good people trying to leverage tech for good.
