If I'm not embarrassed about how I taught it the last time, I'm not on
the right trajectory.

That was a side comment made by Colleen Lewis, Professor at UIUC
during a session at CSTA 2025.

While I understood the sentiment, I didn't necessarily agree with it
literally.

I mean, I've probably taught over twenty thousand lessons in my
career an I don't think I ever felt embarrassed about a lesson. I
wasn't always happy with my performance but I don't think
embarrassed. Of course however I felt, I didn't let it stop me from
self-evaluating and trying to improve and that, I think is really what
Colleen was getting at.

In any event, it got me thinking of my evolution as a teacher over the
years.
