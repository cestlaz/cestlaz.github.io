If I'm not embarrassed about how I taught it the last time, I'm not on
the right trajectory.

That was a side comment made by Colleen Lewis, Professor at UIUC
during a session at CSTA 2025.

While I understood the sentiment, I didn't necessarily agree with it
literally.

I mean, I've probably taught over twenty thousand lessons in my
career an I don't think I ever felt embarrassed about a lesson. I
wasn't always happy with my performance but I don't think
embarrassed. Of course however I felt, I didn't let it stop me from
self-evaluating and trying to improve and that, I think is really what
Colleen was getting at.

In any event, it got me thinking of my evolution as a teacher over the
years.

An early career teacher might look at control to gauge a lesson - were
the kids distracted or did they seem to be paying attention. Maybe an
attentive class would be perceived to be good. Of course, one quickly
learns that just because a student looks attentive, it doesn't mean
they are. Even if they are it doesn't mean they're learning.

Sure, as a baseline, if you can't control disruptive students
(something that's frequently really not in a teacher's control) you
probably won't be delivering a great lesson but assuming basic class
control, I realized that the things that excited me early on when
reflecting on a lesson didn't necessarily mean that the lesson hit its
mark.

I remember teaching a lesson early in my career - the quadratic
formula. The class seemed to be engaged and seemed to get it. I love
the lesson topic - it's one of the first times kids get to derive
something. They had been solving quadratics by completing the square
for a few days and now all of a sudden they're able to create a
general formula that they can use over and over again.

Pretty cool.

As I said, I thought it was a good lesson. Kids seemed to be engaged
and seemed to "get it." Looking back, I'm not as convinced. When I
looked back I didn't think it was a bad lesson but it wasn't as great
as I thought. As it turned out, it was probably average for me. The
kids seemed to pick up the material from the lesson pretty much as
well (or as poorly) as they did other topics and I'm not sure that
they got any real appreciation from the derivation part.
