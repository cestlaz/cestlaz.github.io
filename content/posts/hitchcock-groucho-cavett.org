I spent yesterday evening at the Leanord Nimoy Thalia theater. Once an
art house cinema, I spent many hours there watching all sorts of
movies - timeless classics, B films, cult movies, and cartoon
nights. Last night, my buddy Ben hosted a movie night screening two
Hitchcock classics - The 39 Steps and The Lady Vanishes. The evening
also included a screening of that Wagnerian masterpiece, What's Opera
Doc!

Now, this doesn't sound like a CS post and it isn't, but I said I'd
expand my range of topics. Hope regular readers don't mind or maybe
even enjoy it.

While I've seen a fair amount of Hitchcock, I hadn't seen either of
these two before.

Besides enjoying the evening it got me thinking - does the upcoming
generation even know Hitchcock.

This wasn't a new thought for me. A couple of weeks ago I was at a
party and I was in a circle of younger people. Something came up and I
mentioned that just the day before I was watching a special on PBS
about Groucho Marx, specifically, his relationship with Dick Cavett,
who interviewed him on television a number of times. Now, I figured
these youngsters would have no idea as to who Dick Cavett was but they
also had no clue about Groucho.

I was a little surprised. I mean the Marx Brothers, and Groucho in
particular as well as Alfred Hitchcock were just ingrained into
American culture. Even if you never saw a Marx Brothers movie you knew
Groucho's walk, mannerisms, and some one liners and even now, I just
searched "Groucho glasses" on line and of course, the iconic
nose/glasses/moustache combo came up. Hitchcock as well. The
"Goodevveenning," the iconic silhouette and of course him being the
master of suspense. We all knew this before ever seeing a Hitchcock
movie as well.

I mean, I get why entertainment icons prior to film and then
television haven't left their mark. Sure, we have the works of the
great composers and authors, but since there was no recorded media, we
have no real knowledge of great singers, comedians, play directors and
the like.

I remember a bunch of years ago learning about [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_L._Fox_(clown)][George Washington
Lafayette Fox]] - a super popular, well, clown in the mid to late
1800s. There are some photographs but of course no film. I only
learned about him by seeing Bill Irwin's amazing tribute, [[https://variety.com/2004/legit/markets-festivals/mr-fox-a-rumination-1200534002/][Mr. Fox a
rumination]]. Of course, Bill Irwin's tribute, while a wonderful show
was in some ways something of a research project.

Years ago I wondered if cultural influences of the film and TV
generations and later would have more staying power. True, media today
has so much of a greater reach than say in the 1950s or even when I
grew up in the 70s and 80s but at least there's a visual record from
the relatively early 20th century, lost films not withstanding and a
visual and audible record since talkies.

The thing is, media consumption has also changed. When I grew up, we
only a handful of channels on TV. Even when cable came in, the choices
were limited. We also didn't have onscreen guides so unless we kept
the NYTimes program guide around or got something like TV Guide
magazine we'd have to flip through the channels. We also, for the most
part didn't have remotes so changing the channel meant getting up,
walking to the TV and clicking the dial - if you missed your channel
you had to go all the way around again.

This meant we'd leave something on becuase it was easier, or we'd be
flipping through the channels and land on something new and we'd just
check it out.

That's how I discovered a lot of old movies - both good and bad and
developed my tastes. From classics aired at random times to Kung Fu
movies on weekends and Chiller theater.

Now, everything's on demand for shows and movies - no discovery, all
active decisions and even worse (from my point of view) the short form
stuff like TicTock and Reels.

So what does this mean for the future? I don't know. It would be a
shame if classics and classic comedy were lost to the future. Sure,
some is just of historic interest but the good stuff really holds up.

Here's a bit of classic Marx Brothers:

More of the interview can be found on Youtube. Actually, there are
tons of Dick Cavett interviews on Youtube and I highly recommend all
of them.

Okay, that's it for today. Probably back to CS and Tech next time out.
