Lets start off with Cleveland and then we'll get to my suggestions for
the CSTA.

* Cleveland

I never had a chance to explore Cleveland before. I was actually in
the city once before, for a junior national fencing competition but
never saw anything other than the competition venue and the hotel.

This time, I didn't have much more of an opportunity. Normally, I like
heading to a conference a day or two early or stay a day or two later
to check out the town but this time, schedules didn't allow it. I
drove in the day before the conference and had to leave before the
conference ended. That basically gave me Tuesday morning - a half day
to explore.

Started the morning with a run by lake Erie.

Afterwards, Devorah and I got breakfast at a local diner and then
wandered the city, or at least the downtown. We used [[https://adventure.geocaching.com/ ][Adventurelab]] as a
guide. Adventurelab is an offshoot of [[https://www.geocaching.com/play ][Geocaching]] where people hide
little boxes all around the world. People find them using a GPS, or
now the app and discover cool places and things. Adventurelab is
essentially the same thing without the little boxes. People write up
the experiences to share local treasures with visitors.

This took us past the Erie Street Cemetery - Cleveland's oldest
existing cemetery, The Hermit Club - "the nation's oldest private club
devoted to the preforming arts," the Old Stone Church, and other local
treasures. Along the way we also passed a great Lebanses bakery, Clevo
Books - a bookstore that specializes in foreign books translated into
English, and other local treasures like the Arcade:

On the way to the Old Stone Church, w passed the [[https://www.soldiersandsailors.com/][Soldiers' and
Sailor's Monument]] - a civil war monument. Outside, we started talking
to a volunteer who was doing some gardening. He gave us a rundown on
the monument and it's history as well as some other local history
including showing us where [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_F._Brush ][Charles F. Brush]] lived, an inventor who
worked on the arc lamp.

We got to talking architecture a bit and mentioned that we had walked
past the Cleveland Bankers Trust Building. He asked if we had gone
inside, now a supermarket. We hadn't but later in the day we
did. Magnificent.

All in all a pretty cool whirlwind tour. That plus the CSTA's
reception at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame let me leave feeling that
I got a reasonable taste of Cleveland.

Now, on to the good and bad from the conference and my suggestions for
the future.

* CSTA the Good and the Bad


First off, great overall conference. I personally would have liked to
see more sessions with more advanced HS content but I also understand
that the majority of conference goers don't really need that.

I'm going to mostly talk about a couple of negative points here and a
couple of small positives since pretty much all the posts up until now
have been glowing. Just remember as you read on - it was a great
conference and just because this post highlights one or two things I
didn't think were terrific, it was still a great conference and I'm
100% going to be back next year. 

I liked how they mixed in regional meetups in the schedule, making it
easier for people to get together although I also appreciate the New
York meetup after the conference which also facilitated that but with
the chapter picking up the tab for drinks and snacks :-) .

One really simple thing I'd suggest is to sell additional tickets to
the opening reception. I know this doesnt' affect a lot of people but
it also should be pretty easy. My wife usually comes with me to
conferences and I know a handful of other people who also bring their
partners. Our partners play tourist by day but they also know some of
the other conference attendees. TL;DR. they'd like to attend that
opening reception but there' no mechanism to do so. To be honest,
we're probably talking about so few people that the door police could
probably just look the other way but why not just charge whatever the
cost is for these few extra people.

They do have +1 tickets available for the "after hours" but those were
expensive. I'm not complaining. Last year, in Las Vegas, a +1 ticket
was either $125 or $150 which seemed like a lot and pool parties
aren't my thing. I was told by someone on the inside though, that the
cost was what the venue wanted so I'm not complaining about the CSTA
here.

This time, I opted to go to the event since I wanted to check out the
R&R Hall of Fame but Devorah opted not to since a regular day ticket
was only $40 vs the $125 for the +1 ticket.

My other big suggestion has to do with the keynotes and the Impact
(nee equity) fellows.

This year, I found all the keynotes lacking, mostly because they were
all really short and this was exacerbated by having pseudo
panels. Losing a good chunk of the keynote slot to one or more impact
fellows didn't do it for me. The keynotes are supposed to be special -
but idea inspirational talks and this year they were mostly teasers
for later sessions. Loosing that chunk of time  makes a difference.

I'll also say that the Impact Fellows talks really didn't do anything
for me. Some of their stories were more compelling than others but we
were in a room of hundreds of teachers and my guess is the story or
the message from one of the Impact fellows isn't any more or less
powerful or relevant than anyone else in the room.

I guess, and I'm sure this isn't a popular opinion, that I don't get
the Impact fellow thing. Sure, it's a nice reward to a small handful
of CS teachers but I'm not seeing the impact. I can't look over the
bios and statements of all the fellows since the CSTA website seems to
be having issues but I've read their articles as they've come out and
seen the bios. Some have come in having been real leaders with real
experience while others are still wet behind the ears. The value of
the content I've seen is also mixed. Some great and some not so great
but in any event, I'm not seeing a lot special, or rather I see as
much or more value from everyday CS teachers who aren't fellows on the
interwebs. Actually, back when blogging was more popular I'd say that
there was more good content being shared and discussed by the
community at large although the community was admittedly smaller.

So anyway, I'm not seeing it. Great reward but to me it takes away
from all the other teachers who aren't Impact fellows who are doing
the same or more. In any event, if you want to highlight the Impact
scholars, make an impact scholars session where they can share their
stories and leave the keynote slots to the keynote speakers.

Just my opinion.

Another small thing that I liked was that email beforehand telling us
that coffee/tea/pastries would or wouldn't be available in the morning
before the start of the first session. This is a small thing but it's
a nice touch. Before I weened myself off caffeine, I needed my cup of
coffee in the morning and hated it when I spent far too much for
overpriced hotel or convention center coffee only to find it there
available at the conference. On the other hand, knowing it was there
was a really nice touch.


So, that was CSTA2025. I got a couple of other side blog post ideas
from the conference so maybe I'll write those up, probably after we
get back from our trip to Italy which we're embarking on soon.

If you were at CSTA2025 I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did and if
you weren't I hope you get a chance to go next year in New Orleans.
